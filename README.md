This is a fork of [indiefan/home_assistant_nanit](https://github.com/indiefan/home_assistant_nanit), which itself is a fork of the original [adam.stanek/nanit](https://gitlab.com/adam.stanek/nanit) project (no longer maintained). This version includes significant enhancements including 2FA support, web dashboard, historical tracking, and modern streaming capabilities.

# Installation & Setup

## Quick Start

1. **Pull and run the container:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=nanit \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 1935:1935 \
  -e NANIT_RTMP_ADDR=YOUR_LOCAL_IP:1935 \
  ghcr.io/maddijoyce/nanit-web
```

2. **Open the web dashboard:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080`
   - If not yet configured, you'll be redirected to the setup page

3. **Complete setup via web interface:**
   - Enter your Nanit email and password
   - Enter the 2FA code sent to your email
   - The system will automatically start monitoring your baby
   - Dashboard will display live data, charts, and video stream

**Security Note:** The refresh token provides full access to your Nanit account. Protect your system and proceed at your own risk.

# Integrations

## Home Assistant

### MQTT Auto-Discovery (Recommended)

When MQTT is enabled, the application publishes Home Assistant discovery
documents and the entities are created automatically, grouped under one device
per camera:

| Entity | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | sensor | °C |
| Humidity | sensor | % |
| Night | binary sensor | Day/night status |
| Stream Alive | binary sensor | Local stream health |
| Night Light | switch | |
| Standby | switch | |
| Volume | number | Camera speaker volume, 0–100 |
| Soundtrack | switch | Built-in sound playback on/off |
| Soundtrack Selection | select | Options come from the camera's own catalog |

Simply enable MQTT in your configuration and devices will appear automatically.
Set `NANIT_MQTT_DISCOVERY=false` to publish state topics without announcing
entities.

The video feed is not announced via discovery; add the camera manually as
described below.

**Soundtrack control is working.** The camera's built-in sounds (White Noise,
Birds, Waves, Wind) are listed via `GET_SOUNDTRACKS` and driven with
`PUT_PLAYBACK`, exposed as the **Soundtrack** switch and the **Soundtrack
Selection** select. Sounds are identified by filename; the select shows them
without the extension.

Because the camera broadcasts playback *stops* but not starts or track changes,
state is read back with `GET_PLAYBACK` at startup and shortly after each command
rather than relying on broadcasts. A track changed in the Nanit app may
therefore lag in Home Assistant until the next command or restart.

### Manual Camera Setup

Alternatively, add a camera manually to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
camera:
  - name: Nanit
    platform: ffmpeg
    input: rtmp://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:1935/local/YOUR_BABY_UID
```

You can find your `baby_uid` in the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` or in the application logs.

# FAQ

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Video streaming fails but sensor data still works?
**A: Connection Limit Errors** - The most common issue is **"too many local connections"** to the Nanit camera:

- **Symptoms**: Video stream fails to connect, but sensor data continues working
- **Cause**: Nanit cameras limit concurrent local streaming connections
- **Behavior**: App continuously retries connection attempts
- **Impact**: Usually doesn't affect the official Nanit mobile app

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait and retry**: Connection limits may clear after a few minutes
2. **Restart the container**: `docker restart nanit`
3. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure camera and app are on same network
4. **Verify RTMP address**: Make sure `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR` uses correct local IP

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Sensor data continues**: Temperature, humidity, day/night status still update
- **Automatic retries**: App persistently attempts to reconnect
- **Mobile app unaffected**: Official Nanit app typically continues working
- **Eventually connects**: Usually succeeds after some time

### Q: VLC (or ffplay/Home Assistant) says it can't open the RTMP URL?
**A:** Two things to check, in order:

1. **Use the address from `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR`**, not the address of the dashboard.
   The RTMP server listens on the port from `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR` (`1935` in the
   examples above), which is separate from the dashboard's HTTP port. With
   `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR=192.168.9.22:1935` the stream URL is
   `rtmp://192.168.9.22:1935/local/YOUR_BABY_UID`. The dashboard's Streaming
   Links panel reads this from the server, so copy the URL from there.
2. **Start the stream first.** The RTMP server is a relay, not a recorder: it
   closes any client that connects while the cam is not publishing, which VLC
   reports as "unable to open the MRL". Start the stream from the dashboard (or
   leave `NANIT_RTMP_AUTO_START=true`) and confirm the log shows
   `New stream publisher connected` before pointing a player at the URL.

### Q: How do I check what's going wrong?
**A:** Check the application logs using the Docker commands from the Installation section:
```bash
# Real-time logs
docker logs -f nanit
# Recent logs  
docker logs --tail 100 nanit
```

### Q: Can I access this remotely/over the internet?
**A:** This should **NOT be exposed directly to the public internet**. For remote access:
- Use a VPN to access your home network
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy) with proper authentication and HTTPS
- Never rely solely on the built-in password protection

## Security & Safety

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** This application accesses your Nanit account and camera feeds. Important considerations:

**Security Risks:**
- **Refresh tokens provide full Nanit account access**
- **Live video streams from your baby's room** 
- **Historical data about your home environment**
- **Device control capabilities**

**Recommendations:**
- Use only within your home network
- Enable the built-in password protection
- Access via local IP addresses (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
- **Never expose directly to the internet**

## Technical Questions

### Q: What ports does this use?
**A:** 
- **Port 8080**: Web dashboard interface
- **Port 1935**: RTMP streaming (for Home Assistant and other RTMP clients)

### Q: Where do I find my baby_uid?
**A:** Your `baby_uid` is displayed in the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` or can be found in the application logs.

### Q: Do I need to be on the same network as my Nanit camera?
**A:** Yes, your Docker host must be on the same network as your Nanit camera, and you must use your local IP address (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) in the `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR` setting.
